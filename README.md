# E-Commerce Back End

  

  ## Description
  This project was a code refactor challenge to create a functional back end database. The starter code, provided through the University of Arizona bootcamp, needed to be updated with sequelize data models, as well as updated api routes. This project utilized sequelize, node.js, express.js, and Insomnia. This project proved to be a chllenge, as I had to dive deep into the sequelize documentation, particularly on the 'through' option. The models themselves were realtively simple but attatching them to the routes was the most challenging aspect. Overall, this project greatly improved my understanding of a back end application.

  Once credentials are written, open mysql in the root directory and run SOURCE db/schema.sql; Quit out of mysql and run 'npm run seed' in the terminal. Finally run 'npm start' in the terminal to start the server.

  ## Usage
